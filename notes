socket.broadcast.emit();

socket.on('hello', function(val) {
	console.log('hello', val) 
	socket.emit('helloBack', val * 2)
})

socket.on('start', function() {

socket.on('click', function() {
	console.log('click')
})

Sockets will first initialize the game socket and then handle the gaming
stuff like play card, slap, etc. 
Click handlers for different buttons have already been added. 

.broadcast means that if you click start in one window, on start the value
shows up in the other person's window. And vice versa. 
Will have to broadcast some things to everyone, broadcast other things
to everyone BUT that player. Etc.
